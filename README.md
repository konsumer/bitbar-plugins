Bitbar plugins I use


These are [Bitbar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar) plugins I use. They have no dependencies other than nodejs, so you should be able to just drop them into your bitbar plugin dir.

## gitlab_ci.10s.js

Watch one Gitlab project's CI status. 

You need to configure `GITLAB_API_KEY` and `GITLAB_PROJECT` at top of file.

`GITLAB_PROJECT` should be the fullname (`GITLAB_USER/PROJECT_NAME`.)
