Bitbar plugins I use


These are [Bitbar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar) plugins I use. They have no dependencies other than nodejs, so you should be able to just drop them into your bitbar plugin dir.

## gitlab_ci.10s.js

If you have `GITLAB_KEY` set in your environment, you can watch all your starred repos on gitlab for CI status.

You can set `GITLAB_KEY` like this:

```
launchctl setenv GITLAB_KEY <YOURS>
```

You can get your token under your face (top-right) / Settings / Access Tokens
